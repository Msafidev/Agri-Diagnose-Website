                <h3>AI Disease Detection</h3>
                <p>
                    Our system uses computer vision to analyze leaf images and detect diseases such as blight, rust,
                    mosaic, and nutrient deficiencies — providing instant diagnosis for farmers.

                <h3>Localized Machine Learning</h3>
                <p>
                    Models are trained using real data from Kenyan farms, ensuring unmatched accuracy for crops like
                    maize, potatoes, tomatoes, sukuma wiki, beans, mangoes, and more.

                <p>
                    Beyond diagnosis, we guide farmers with actionable steps: treatments, fertilizer plans, pest
                    prevention, planting schedules, and market insights.
